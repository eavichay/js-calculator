## Description

**The calculator allows basic arithmetic operations:**

 `+` - addition\
 
 `-` - subtraction\
 
 `*` - multiplication\
 
 `รท` - division
 
 `AC` - reset calculations.
 
**The calculator allows to compute trigonometric functions:**
 
 `sin` - the sine function
 
 `cos` - the cosine function
 
 `tg` - the tangent function
 
 `ctg` - the cotangent function
 
**The calculator allows memory operations:**

 `MS` - The MS button stores the currently displayed result in memory.

 `M+` - The M+ button adds the current result to the one in memory. So, if you had stored a 20, and the current result is a 5, your memory would contain 25 when you press it. If the memory is empty, it acts like MS and simply stores the result.

 `MR` - The MR button gets the value stored in memory and puts it in the display.

 `MC` - The MC button clears the memory.
